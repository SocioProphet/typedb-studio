## TypeDB Studio

![TypeDB Studio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/567679/45933937-7987bc00-bf8e-11e8-8b26-8fb020c77310.png)

TypeDB Studio is TypeDB's Integrated Development Environment to perform knowledge engineering. At this time, alpha releases allow you to visualise and explore your data!

You can also see Studio as an alternative to the [TypeDB Console](http://docs.vaticle.com/docs/running-typedb/console) and [TypeDB Clients](http://docs.vaticle.com/docs/client-api/overview),
all of which allow you to connect to your TypeDB instance.

TypeDB Studio enables inference, highlighting the concepts which are inferred when visualising answers to your query. Double click the inferred concepts to retrieve their explanations and visualise how the fact was inferred.

Whether you need a tool to test and experiment with your newly created TypeDB database, or you prefer a graphical interface for reading data from TypeDB, you will find Studio extremely useful.

## Download TypeDB Studio
TypeDB Studio is available for Linux, Mac and Windows. Head over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-studio/releases) to download and install the latest release of Studio.
